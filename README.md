# nHen-Lookup
A non-published Chrome/Edge extension to search text on nHentai.

Why? Mainly because I wanted to learn how Chrome extensions worked, so I made one I for sure knew wasn't in the Chrome Web Store.

So... I made this as my first extension, but when I tried to publish it Google said "nope", so I'll leave it here for anyone who want to install it.

## How do I install it?
I'll leave the .crx available in the "Releases" page, just go to your "Manage Extensions" page in your browser, Enable "Developer Mode" and drag/drop the .crx file.
